# 42 Core Projects 🚀  

Welcome to my **42 Core Projects** repository! Here, I document the projects I’ve completed during my journey at [42 Kuala Lumpur](https://www.42kl.edu.my), where I’m learning Computer Science through a peer-to-peer and project-based curriculum.  

## 📌 Completed Projects  
Here are the projects I’ve completed so far:  

| Project           | Description |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Libft**         | A custom implementation of the C standard library functions. |
| **get_next_line** | A function to read a line from a file descriptor efficiently. |
| **ft_printf**     | A recreation of the C `printf` function, supporting various format specifiers. |
| **so_long**       | A small 2D game built using the MinilibX graphics library. |
| **pipex**         | A project that replicates shell piping (**&#124;**) behavior in C. |
| **push_swap**     | An efficient sorting algorithm project using two stacks and a limited set of operations. |
| **minishell**     | A mini shell implementation that handles parsing, built-ins, redirections, pipes, and signals. |
| **philosophers**  | A concurrency and multithreading project simulating the classic dining philosophers problem. |

## 🛠️ Current Project  
I'm currently working on **NetPractice**, where I’m learning about IP addressing, subnetting, and basic networking logic through interactive simulations.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **C Programming Language**  
- **Makefile**  
- **Shell Scripting**  
- **MinilibX (for graphics in so_long)**  
- **POSIX Threads (for philosophers)**  
- **Unix System Calls**
